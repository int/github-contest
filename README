This is just the simple and fun run.

No professional/specialized/state-of-art recsys algorithms.

Among algorithms used in the code, two are most 'effective':

1. co-ocurrences pair
2. repo tree walk-up

Others (stat on lang, watchers, etc.) does not improve the result much.


The co-occurrences info is dumped at first time run and can be directly
loaded at later runs.
